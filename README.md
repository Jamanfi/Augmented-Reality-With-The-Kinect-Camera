# augmentedRealityWithTheKinectCamera
Augmented reality tool using the Xbox 360 Kinect Camera

This is my Level 3 project for my BSc Computer Science at the University of Lincoln.

Please note the work done in this project does not reflect my current ability.

Uses a Kinect Camera for the Xbox 360 and its API to capture and deduce limb location information from a live image feed, and then superimposes various objects onto the image which can be manipulated by the user.
